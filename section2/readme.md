## Section 2

You are appointed by a car dealership to create their database infrastructure. There is only one store. In each business day, cars are being sold by a team of salespersons. Each transaction would contain information on the date and time of transaction, customer transacted with, and the car that was sold. 

The following are known:
- Each car can only be sold by one salesperson.
- There are multiple manufacturersâ€™ cars sold.
- Each car has the following characteristics:
- Manufacturer
- Model name
- Serial number
- Weight
- Price

Each sale transaction contains the following information:
- Customer Name
- Customer Phone
- Salesperson
- Characteristics of car sold

---

## Data model

- Assumptions:
    - Cars can have a different selling price at different sale prices.
    - Individual cars will always have the same manufacturer, model name, and weight, and unique serial number.
    - A dim_date table at day level is necessary.

- Dimension Tables:
    - Salesperson
    - Date
    - Customer
    - Cars

- Fact Tables:
    - Sale transaction

## ETL Strategy

Data is to be received as Transactional Facts with the following columns:

| Column | Desc |
|---|---|
| Customer Name ||
| Customer Phone||
| Salesperson Name? | Assume unique, can be id |
| Car characteristics | Assume consistent, can be used to build dimensions on ingestion, alternatively, can be used to query the dim_car if it was pre-populated. |

Build ORM representation for dialect agnostic, test locally on sqlite db.

## Querying

Build queries based on orm representation, using sqlalchemy as glue.

## Docker-compose

Docker compose is used to initialise the database, the db migration initialisation is handled with SQLAlchemy, to remain dialect agnostic. Because of that, a separate container is used to populate initial dimension tables as necessary.

Run docker-compose up at docker-compose.yml file to start the containers. Python container will run initialising script and shutdown. 
```
docker-compose up
```
